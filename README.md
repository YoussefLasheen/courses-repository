# Courses I completed 

I took various courses online from Udacity and Coursera.\
Most of them were a scholarship form the Ministry of **Communications and Information Technology**. God bless them

I made this repository to organize and categorize the courses and their respective projects for future employers and for me becuase I have a very bad memory.
